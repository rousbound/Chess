\section{Program Scope}

The program should be able to receive as input a chess move in UCI(Universal
Chess Interface) format i.e
e2e4, and if the movement is valid, output the board state to the user or inform
the user the input isn't valid. For this matter, the standard python libraries is
enough address the problem. For debugging purposes, a graphical interface was
also required and implemented in pygame, a graphical framework for games. Also
for preparing the tests, it was used the program
\textit{pgn-extract} to convert PGN game notation to UCI notation, although, not
necessary for running nor testing. For running the tests, pytest was used.


\section{Program project}

The project is constitued by four modules that contains in itself their
respective major class: The Piece, Board, Chess and GUI.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Pieces module contains the Piece class, that is inherited by all
        the chess pieces, and specify how to get from each piece their own set
        of possible moves.
        \item The Board module contains the Board class that is used to save and
            process all
            information relative to board state, such as pieces positions,
            castling rights, number of turns, en passeant possibility, etc.
            And with that it information it can save and load the board state
            in the form of a FEN(Forsythâ€“Edwards
            Notation)\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth\%E2\%80\%93Edwards_Notation}}
        \item The Chess module contains the Chess class that is used to process
            the Board information and create legal moves from which the player
            can chose to play.
        \item The GUI module uses the Board and Chess classes to play the game
            in a graphical interface mode.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Testing}

Three approaches were made to certify the accuracy of the game:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
\item Shannon's Calculations
\item Brute force complex positions and comparing with a proof table of possible
    moves. 
\item Specific tests to test draw conditions
\end{enumerate}

To execute all the tests we run the following command at the top level directory of the project, i.e ``/project''
\begin{lstlisting}
pytests tests
\end{lstlisting}

or for specifict tests, we can also run for example:

\begin{lstlisting}
pytests tests/testdraw.py
\end{lstlisting}

The result of both tests will be located at ``project/logs''


\subsection{Shannon's Number}


\begin{table}[H]
\center
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Number of plies (half-moves)}  & \textbf{Number of possible games}  \\
\hline
  1   & 20 \\
\hline
   2  &  400 \\
\hline
  3   & 8092 \\
\hline
4  & 197,281 \\
\hline
5   & 4,865,609 \\
\hline
6   & 119,060,324 \\
\hline
\ldots & \ldots \\
\hline
10 & 69,352,859,712,417 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Shannon's Calculation. Obs: A turn is composed by a white move and a black move. Five plies
therefore stands for white playing three times and black two.}
\end{table}

For basic operations accuracy, it was used the Shannon Number,
which stands for all the possible moves that can be played until a certain
ply(half-move). By the limitation of the computer power avaible for our
disposal, and considering that the game was not written in a language nor
written in a way for fast computation, we could only check the precision of the
game until 5 ply, as we can see by the test log:
\begin{lstlisting}
2022-01-22 00:00:36,742 Result of possible games with 1 ply: 20/20 - OK
2022-01-22 00:00:36,742 Elapsed time in 1 ply: 00h00m00s seconds
2022-01-22 00:00:37,312 Result of possible games with 2 ply: 400/400 - OK
2022-01-22 00:00:37,312 Elapsed time in 2 ply: 00h00m00s seconds
2022-01-22 00:00:52,137 Result of possible games with 3 ply: 8902/8902 - OK
2022-01-22 00:00:52,137 Elapsed time in 3 ply: 00h00m14s seconds
2022-01-22 00:07:11,715 Result of possible games with 4 ply: 197281/197281 - OK
2022-01-22 00:07:11,715 Elapsed time in 4 ply: 00h06m19s seconds
2022-01-22 08:45:00,073 Result of possible games with 5 ply: 4865609/4865609 - OK
2022-01-22 08:45:00,073 Elapsed time in 5 ply: 08h37m48s seconds
    
\end{lstlisting}

Although this is a good signal that basic operations are working, in 5 plies we
cannot test all the complications that might arise during a chess game.

\begin{table}[H]
\center
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Depth}   & \textbf{Captures} & \textbf{E.P} &
\textbf{Castles} & \textbf{Promotions} & \textbf{Checks} & \textbf{Dscry
Checks} & \textbf{Dbl Checks} & \textbf{Checkmates} \\
\hline
   1  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
   2  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
   3  & 34 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 12 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
   4  & 1576 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 469 & 0 & 0 & 8 \\
\hline
5  & 82,719 & 258 & 0 & 0 & 27,251 & 6 & 0 & 347 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Number of ``special'' moves by depth accordingly to
\url{https://www.chessprogramming.org/Perft_Results} }
\end{table}

By this table we can see that we need to concentrate our efforts in testing
Castle, Promotions, Discovery Checks and Double Checks. Because they don't arise
until moves later than 5.

\subsection{Brute forcing complex positions}


One way to test them, is loading ``complex positions'', which contain in its
possibilities: Castling, promotion, discovery checks and double checks, brute
force their
possible moves, and compare the results with a proof table. Using the
positions recommended in \url{https://www.chessprogramming.org/Perft_Results},
with their respective proof table,
we get the following result from 5 ``complex positions'':

\end{lstlisting}

By doing these tests, we can be relativery certain that the ``special moves'' are working
as desired.

\subsection{Specific tests for Draws}

Because Draws take so long to happen, they very rarely appear in brute forcing
tests. Because of that, we made specific tests, that have this logic.
For example, we feed this list of moves: 

\begin{lstlisting}

movedraw50 = ["d2d4 g8f6 c2c4 g7g6 b1c3 f8g7 e2e4 d7d6 g1f3 e8g8 f1e2 e7e5 e1g1
b8c6 d4d5 c6e7 f3d2 a7a5 a1b1 f6d7 a2a3 f7f5 b2b4 g8h8 f2f3 e7g8 d1c2 g8f6 c3b5

g7g6 d5f4 g6g7 f3d4 a1e1 e5f5 e1c1 g4e2 c1e1 e2h5 e1a1 f4e6 g7h6 h5e8 a1a8 e8c6

h8g8 g6e7 g8h8 e6g5", "7k/4N3/5K2/5BN1/8/8/8/r7 b - - 100 113"]

\end{lstlisting}

Into our specific test function:

\begin{lstlisting}
    for test in tests:

        chess = Chess()
        fen = chess.test_input_moves(test[0].split(" "))
        r = fen == test[1]
        result = "OK" if r else "ERROR"
        logging.info(f"Test with fen {test[1]} resulted in: {result}")
        assert r

    logging.info(f"DRAW TEST SUCCESSFUL")

\end{lstlisting}

The test plays the game move by move, and prints the result of the comparison between the expected board state
result(FEN) with the FEN given by our function call. If our game returns the
exact expected FEN, the test was successfull.

Similar tests were made with:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
\item Insufficient material
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic{enumii}.\arabic*)]
    \item Opposite colors bishops draw
    \item Knight and King vs King
    \item Bishop and King vs King
    \item King vs King
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item Stalemate 
    \item Three Fold Repetition
    \item 50 move without pawn move or capture
\end{enumerate}

And their result can be found on the log:
\begin{lstlisting}

>>> $ pytest tests/test_draws.py
17:00:16 ----------------------------------------
17:00:17 Test with fen 7k/4N3/5K2/5BN1/8/8/8/r7 b - - 100 113 resulted in: OK

17:00:20 Test with fen 8/8/8/6k1/8/5K2/8/8 w - - 0 158 resulted in: OK
17:00:20 DRAW TEST SUCCESSFUL

\end{lstlisting}

With all these tests, we can be relatively sure that the game will be successfully
executed in the great majority of cases.



\section{User Docs}

\subsection{Installation}

Assuming you already have installed python and pip, the user only needs to run:
\begin{lstlisting}
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt.
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Usage}

There are three ways to interact with this program, by directly calling their
functions in the interpreter or in a script, by calling the $play\_cli()$ or the
$play\_gui()$ functions. 

\subsubsection{play\_cli() and play\_gui()}



You can enter directly the CLI interface by running: $\$~python3~main.py~-cli$.
Here the program enters in a loop and continously asks moves until it reaches a
endgame condition, such as checkmate or draw.

\begin{lstlisting}

*********************************

7| p | p | p | p | p | p | p | p |

Move:

\end{lstlisting}

You can also enter directly the GUI interface by running:
$\$~python3~main.py~-gui$. There is no time control, just dragging and dropping
pieces, and promoting pawns. The program takes care of prohibiting illegal moves
and moving enemy pieces while not your turn. Just as the play\_cli(), the game
goes on as long as it doesn't reach an endgame condition.

    \caption{Overview of different states of the game while in GUI. With a

\subsubsection{Other Uses}

By importing the mychess module, we open other possibilities, like loading a
position and playing it from there.
