\section{Program Scope}

The program should be able to receive as input a chess move in UCI(Universal
Chess Interface) format i.e
e2e4, and if the movement is valid, output the board state to the user or inform
the user the input isn't valid. For this matter, the standard python library is
enough address the problem. For debugging purposes, a graphical interface was
also required and implemented in pygame, a graphical framework for games. Also
for debugging and testing purposes, it was used the program
\textit{pgn-extract} to convert PGN game notation to UCI notation.


\section{Program project}

The project is constitued by four modules that contains in itself their
respective major class: The Piece, Board, Chess and GUI.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Pieces module contains the Piece class, that is inherited by all
        the chess pieces, and specify how to get from each piece their own set
        of possible moves.
        \item The Board module contains the Board class that is used to save all
            information relative to board state, such as pieces positions,
            castling rights, number of turns, en passeant possibility, etc.
        \item The Chess module contains the Chess class that is used to process
            the Board information and create legal moves from which the player
            can chose to play.
        \item The GUI module uses the Board and Chess classes to play the game
            in a graphical interface mode.
\end{enumerate}

\caption{Shannon's Calculation. Obs: A turn is composed by a white move and a black move. Five plies
therefore stands for white playing three times and black two.}
\end{table}

For basic operations accuracy, it was used the Shannon Number,
which stands for all the possible moves that can be played until a certain
ply(half-move). By the limitation of the computer power avaible for our
disposal, and considering that the game was not written in a language nor
written in a way for fast computation, we could only check the precision of the
game until 5 ply, as we can see by the test log:
\begin{lstlisting}

2022-01-22 08:45:00,073 Elapsed time in 5 ply: 08h37m48s seconds
    
\end{lstlisting}

Although this is a good signal that basic operations are working, in 5 plies we
cannot test all the complications that might arise during a chess game.

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Depth}   & \textbf{Captures} & \textbf{E.P} &
\textbf{Castles} & \textbf{Promotions} & \textbf{Checks} & \textbf{Dscry

   1  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Number of ``special'' moves by depth accordingly to
\url{https://www.chessprogramming.org/Perft_Results} }
\end{table}

By this table we can see that we need to concentrate our efforts in testing
Castle, Promotions, Discovery Checks and Double Checks.

One way to test them, is loading ``complex positions'', which contain it its
possibilities, castling, promotion, discovery checks and double checks, and brute forcing their
possible moves, and comparing the results with a proof table. Using the
positions recommended in \url{https://www.chessprogramming.org/Perft_Results},
we get the following result from 5 ``complex positions'':

By doing these tests, we can be certain that the program is working as desired.

\section{User Docs}

There are three ways to interact with this program, by directly calling their
functions in the interpreter or in a script, by calling the $play\_cli()$ or the
$play\_gui()$ functions. 

\subsection{play\_cli() and play\_gui()}

You can enter directly the CLI interface by running: $\$~python3~main.py~-cli$.
Here the program enters in a loop and continously asks moves until it reaches a
endgame condition, such as checkmate or draw.

\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

You can also enter directly the GUI interface by running:
$\$~python3~main.py~-gui$. There is no time control, just dragging and dropping
pieces, and promoting pawns. The program takes care of prohibiting illegal moves
and moving enemy pieces while not your turn. Just as the play\_cli(), the game
goes on as long as it doesn't reach an endgame condition.

\subsection{Other Uses}

By importing the mychess module, we open other possibilities, like loading a
position and playing it from there.
